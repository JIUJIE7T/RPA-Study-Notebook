# Attended robots and Unattended Robots

## Attended robots
__Attended robots work on the same workstations as humans and execute some tasks of the entire process, after which they require human intervention.__

### When are they generally used
In business scenarios that require input or decision making from the human user, or when a well-defined schedule cannot be applied due to the volatility of the process.

### What are some specific scenarios in which Attended Robots are preferable
- The automated process relies on data that needs to be validated by humans
- The robot assists the human directly in performing his tasks
- The automated task cannot be scheduled beforehand and needs manual triggering

### How should the Attended Robots be
- Responsive: when triggered, the attended robot needs to do his part in order to enable the human to take care of the no-automated tasks
- User-friendly: the human user needs to be able to operate the robot easily
- Flexibility: the Attended Robot needs to be able to navigate between different applications and environments.



## Unattended Robots
__Unattended robots work independently of any human interaction. Also, they work on separate, virtual workstaitons.__

### When are they generally used
In manual, repetitive, highly rule-based back office activities, which do not require any human intervention.

### What are some specific scenarios in which Unattended Robots are preferable
- Tasks must be completed continuously in a batch-mode model
- Large amounts of data have to be gathered, sorted, analyzed, and distributed amongst key players in an organization
- The output of the automated process is needed as an input for humans in their work.

### How should the Unattended Robots be
- Flexible to deploy on virtual or remote environments: since the human intervention is minimal，The Unattended Robots are generally deployed to virtual or remote environments

- Easy to scale: the Unattended Robots need to accommodate variation of task and data volumes
- Accurate: because human intervention lacks or is minimal, the ouputs have to be reliable

# Determine the automation potential
## Automation First mindset
For this you need to know the types of processes that can be automated, the factors driving the automation potential, as well as the factors that increase the complexity of a process and make it more difficult to automate.

## Business Process and Procedure

### What is a business process
__Definition__ : A process is a set of interrelated or interacting activities that transforms inputs into outputs.

- __Components of a process:__
  - __Inputs__ - the data that goes in the process;
  - __Process Flows__ - the sequences of sub-processes or activities undertaken in the process;
  - __Source Applications__ - the applications or systems used to perform the sub^processes or activities of the process;
  - __Outputs__ - the result generated by the process;
- __Things to remember:__ The outputs of a process can serve as inputs for other processes.

### What is a procedure

a procedure complemets a process and describes the way it is carried out; it explains who is responsible for each part of the process, when each part of the process needs to occur, how to handle exceptions and the specifications applicable to each part of the process.

__A procedure explains:__
- who is responsible for each part of the process
- when each part of the process needs to occur
- how to handle exceptions
- the specifications applicable to each part of the process.
