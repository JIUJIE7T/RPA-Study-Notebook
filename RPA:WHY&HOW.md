# How is automation impacting us?
RPA, or Robotic Process Automation, is the technology that enables computer software to emulate and integrate actions typically performed by human interacting with digital systems.

## RPA's advantages
- Without making mistakes(error-free) and without rest
- Quick to implement and powerful to scale
- Mimics human actions
- Operates any application
- Reads and actions data in structured form

# Overview of RPA in business

## Examples of RPA in business

1. Payroll Processing
 - Payroll processing refers to the actions that companies take to pay their employees - keeping track of their presence, of their salaries, bonuses and taxes
 - Payroll processing needs manual intervention month after month, every year. An RPA system can be used to extract the details that are required from handwritted time sheets and calculate the pay from their stipulated contracts and pay them as well (by even ordering the necessary bank transactions).

2. Client Information Updates
3. Renewal Process
4. Statement Reconciliation
5. Compliance Reporting
6. Customer Complaint Processing

## Why RPA is a good starting point for a company's digital transformation?

1. RPA is no-invasive
- It does not require any major IT architecture changes or deep integration
2. RPA is easy to scale
- The amount of work involved by a process can vary, as changes are likely to occur in most business environments.
3. RPA is future proof

# Attended robots and Unattended Robots

## Attended robots
__Attended robots work on the same workstations as humans and execute some tasks of the entire process, after which they require human intervention.__

### When are they generally used
In business scenarios that require input or decision making from the human user, or when a well-defined schedule cannot be applied due to the volatility of the process.

### What are some specific scenarios in which Attended Robots are preferable
- The automated process relies on data that needs to be validated by humans
- The robot assists the human directly in performing his tasks
- The automated task cannot be scheduled beforehand and needs manual triggering

### How should the Attended Robots be
- Responsive: when triggered, the attended robot needs to do his part in order to enable the human to take care of the no-automated tasks
- User-friendly: the human user needs to be able to operate the robot easily
- Flexibility: the Attended Robot needs to be able to navigate between different applications and environments.



## Unattended Robots
__Unattended robots work independently of any human interaction. Also, they work on separate, virtual workstaitons.__

### When are they generally used
In manual, repetitive, highly rule-based back office activities, which do not require any human intervention.

### What are some specific scenarios in which Unattended Robots are preferable
- Tasks must be completed continuously in a batch-mode model
- Large amounts of data have to be gathered, sorted, analyzed, and distributed amongst key players in an organization
- The output of the automated process is needed as an input for humans in their work.

### How should the Unattended Robots be
- Flexible to deploy on virtual or remote environments: since the human intervention is minimal，The Unattended Robots are generally deployed to virtual or remote environments

- Easy to scale: the Unattended Robots need to accommodate variation of task and data volumes
- Accurate: because human intervention lacks or is minimal, the ouputs have to be reliable
